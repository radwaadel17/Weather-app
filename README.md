🚀 Weather App! 🌦️

I'm thrilled to introduce my latest Flutter project: a dynamic Weather App designed to keep you updated with accurate and real-time weather information. Using the BLoC pattern for efficient state management, this app not only delivers reliable weather forecasts but also offers an intuitive and sleek user experience.

Key Features:

- Real-Time Weather Updates: Get the latest weather conditions for any location.
- Forecasts: View hourly and daily forecasts to plan your day or week ahead.
- User-Friendly Interface: Clean and modern design that enhances usability and accessibility.
- BLoC Architecture: Ensures smooth and responsive performance by managing state effectively.

Developed with passion and attention to detail, this app aims to provide users with all the weather information they need at their fingertips. I'm excited to continue refining this project and exploring new features!
